# Shapes
Demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming in Python

- Program the uses customized objects as 2D shapes with certain arguments for basic dimensions such as radius, side lengths, etc.
- Once initialized, program calculates higher/more complex dimensions (such as area and perimeter). These dimensions may be called as methods.
- All classes also come with a function to modify the initial arguments of each shape. Program then recalculates the higher dimensions which then be again called as methods.
